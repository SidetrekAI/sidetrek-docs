# BI Stack Example Project

<SubH1>Let's see what we can do with the data pipeline you just created by exploring the example project.</SubH1>

If you opted in to adding the example project during `sidetrek init`, you should now have a fully functional data pipeline that you can explore.

Let's take a look at each part of this example project to see what's going on.

## The Dataset

We've included a simple dataset with four tables: `orders`, `customers`, `products`, and `stores`. This emulates the typical e-commerce data.

Each table has its own csv file in the `/your_project/data` directory.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-8">
<div className="col-span-1">
#### Orders Table

<div className="max-w-[320px]">
| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| order_id | string |
| ordered_at | timestamp |
| product_id | string |
| product_qty | integer |
| customer_id | string |
| store_id | string |
</div>
</div>

<div className="col-span-1">
#### Customers Table

<div className="max-w-[320px]">
| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| customer_id | string |
| customer_name | string |
| first_name | string |
| last_name | string |
| gender | string |
| country | string |
| address | string |
| phone_no | string |
| email | string |
| payment_method | string |
| traffic_source | string |
| customer_age | integer |
| device_type | string |
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-8">
<div className="col-span-1">
#### Products Table

<div className="max-w-[320px]">
| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| product_id | string |
| product_name | string |
| product_category | string |
| unit_price | float |
| product_description | string |
</div>
</div>

<div className="col-span-1">
#### Stores Table

<div className="max-w-[320px]">
| Field | Type |
| --- | --- |
| store_id | string |
| store_name | string |
| store_city | string |
| store_state | string |
| tax_rate | float |
</div>
</div>
</div>

## Data Ingestion

Data ingestion is handled by Meltano. Meltano is a managed connector that already has a number of pre-built connectors to popular data sources and targets. Essentially, it handles the EL ("Extract, Load") part of the ELT process.

Just as a quick reminder, here's where Meltano is in the project structure:

```plaintext {10}
your_project
├── .sidetrek
├── .venv
├── superset
├── trino
└── your_project
    ├── dagster
    ├── data
    ├── dbt
    └── meltano
```

### Meltano extractor and loader

To use Meltano to ingest data, you need to set up two things: 1) extractor (or "tap") and 2) loader ("target").

In our example project, our data is stored in CSV files and we want to load that data into Iceberg tables, so we're using the `tap-csv` extractor and `target-iceberg` loader.

Note that currently, there are no official Meltano target for Iceberg, so we've created a custom target. This is also open-source, so feel free to check out the source code [here](https://github.com/SidetrekAI/target-iceberg).

#### Add the Extractor

<BashCode code="meltano add extractor tap-csv" />

Configure the extractor by updating the meltano.yml file in the /meltano directory like this:

```yaml title="meltano/your_project/__init__.py" showLineNumbers
...
plugins:
  extractors:
    - name: tap-csv
      ...
      config:
        csv_files_definition: extract/csv_files_def.json
```




## Next Steps

Congrats! You've successfully set up a data pipeline from scratch with Sidetrek.

This should give you a pretty good start on how to build your own data pipeline.
