# BI Stack Example Project

<SubH1>Let's take a look at the BI stack example project.</SubH1>

If you opted in to adding the example project during `sidetrek init`, you should have a fully functional data pipeline already set up.

Let's take a look at each part of this example project to see what's going on.

## The Tools

This stack consists of the following tools:

- **Dagster** for orchestration
- **Meltano** for data ingestion
- **DBT** for data transformation
- **Minio** (local replacement for S3) and **Apache Iceberg** for data storage
- **Trino** for data querying
- **Superset** for data visualization

In the example project, all these tools are pre-configured and connected for you.

## The Dataset

We've included a simple dataset with four tables: `orders`, `customers`, `products`, and `stores`. This emulates the typical e-commerce data.

Each table has its own csv file in the `/your_project/data` directory.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-8">
<div className="col-span-1">
#### Orders Table

<div className="max-w-[320px]">

| order_id | string |
| ordered_at | timestamp |
| product_id | string |
| product_qty | integer |
| customer_id | string |
| store_id | string |
</div>
</div>

<div className="col-span-1">
#### Customers Table

<div className="max-w-[320px]">

</div>
</div>
</div>

## Data Ingestion

Data ingestion is handled by Meltano. Meltano is a managed connector with hundreds of pre-built connectors to popular data sources and targets. Essentially, it handles the EL ("Extract, Load") part of the ELT process.

As a quick reminder, here's where Meltano fits into the project structure:

```plaintext {10}
your_project
├── .sidetrek
├── .venv
├── superset
├── trino
└── your_project
    ├── dagster
    ├── data
    ├── dbt
    └── meltano
```

### Meltano Extractor and Loader

To use Meltano to ingest data, you need to set up two things: 1) an extractor ("tap") and 2) a loader ("target").

<MyAlert variant="info" title="Taps and Targets?" description='Meltano follows the Singer protocol for their extractors and loaders. In the Singer protocol, extractors are called "taps" and loaders are called "targets".' />

In our example project, our data is stored in CSV files and we want to load that data into Iceberg tables, so we're using the tap-csv extractor and target-iceberg loader.

Note that currently, there is no official Meltano target for Iceberg, so we've created a custom target. This is also open-source, so feel free to check out the source code [here](https://github.com/SidetrekAI/target-iceberg).

<MyAlert variant="warning" title="Currently, `target-iceberg` only supports APPEND operation!" description="`target-iceberg` implements pyiceberg underneath and it does not yet support merge operation for incremental ingestion. All data is appended during ingestion so if you need to do any deduping, you'll have to do it during the transformation stage." />

#### Adding the Extractor

We've already added and configured the extractor for you in the example project, but we'll go through the setup so you can acquaint yourself with the setup. 

To install an extractor, you can run a command like this:

<BashCode code="meltano add extractor tap-csv" client:load />

Replace `tap-csv` with the name of the extractor you want to add. See the [Meltano documentation](https://meltano.com/docs/) for more information on how to work with Meltano.

Once the extractor is installed, it needs to be configured. We've also done this for you in the example project. You can see it in meltano.yml file in the /meltano directory.

```yaml title="meltano/meltano.yml" showLineNumbers
...
plugins:
  extractors:
    - name: tap-csv
      ...
      config:
        csv_files_definition: extract/example_csv_files_def.json
```

`csv_files_definition` field lets Meltano know where to find the CSV files. If you look at that file, you'll see something like this:
  
```json title="meltano/extract/example_csv_files_def.json" showLineNumbers
[
  { "entity": "orders", "path": "../data/example/orders.csv", "keys": ["id"] },
  { "entity": "customers", "path": "../data/example/customers.csv", "keys": ["id"] },
  { "entity": "products", "path": "../data/example/products.csv", "keys": ["id"] },
  { "entity": "stores", "path": "../data/example/stores.csv", "keys": ["id"] }
]
```

It basically tells Meltano where to find the CSV files and what the primary keys are for each table.

#### Adding the Loader

Once the extractor is set up, it's time to add the loader. This is where you tell Meltano where to load the data to.

In the example project, we're loading the data into Iceberg tables. We've already added and configured the loader for you in the example project, but if you want to add your own later, you can do it like this:

<BashCode code="meltano add --custom loader target-iceberg" client:load />

Note that you typically don't need the `--custom` flag if you're using one of the existing Meltano loaders.

Configuring the loader is similar to configuring the extractor. You can find the configuration in the meltano.yml file in the /meltano directory.

```yaml title="meltano/meltano.yml" showLineNumbers
...
plugins:
  ...
  loaders:
    - name: target-iceberg
      namespace: target_iceberg
      pip_url: git+https://github.com/SidetrekAI/target-iceberg@bugfix/fields
      executable: target-iceberg
      config:
        add_record_metadata: true
        aws_access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        aws_secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        s3_endpoint: http://localhost:9000
        s3_bucket: lakehouse
        iceberg_rest_uri: http://localhost:8181
        iceberg_catalog_name: icebergcatalog
        iceberg_catalog_namespace_name: raw
```

It requires AWS credentials, an S3 endpoint (which is a Minio endpoint in our case since we're using Minio as an S3 replacement for our development environment), and Iceberg-related configurations.

Iceberg is a table format that sits on top of a physical storage layer like S3. When you load data into Iceberg tables, the actual data is stored as files in S3, and Iceberg specifies how those files are organized into tables we're familiar with.

In essence, Iceberg makes object storage like S3 work like a relational database or data warehouse.

This is why this loader requires AWS credentials and a Minio endpoint, not just Iceberg configurations.

To learn more about how Iceberg works, check out the [Iceberg documentation](https://iceberg.apache.org/).

### Running Meltano Ingestion

Now that we have the Meltano extractor and loader installed and configured, we can run the ingestion.

You can run it manually by executing the following command:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano run tap-csv target-iceberg" client:load />

`sidetrek run` here is a simple convenience wrapper around `meltano run *` command. It runs the meltano CLI inside the project virtual env and also sets the cwd to /meltano directory.

It's identical to running:

<BashCode code="cd your_project/meltano && poetry run meltano run tap-csv target-iceberg" client:load />

### Running Meltano Ingestion Inside the Dagster Pipeline

We saw how we can trigger the ingestion manually with the CLI, but often we want to run the ingestion inside the orchestrator (Dagster). For example, we might want to schedule the ingestion to run daily.

In the example project, we've already added a job to run the Meltano ingestion in the Dagster pipeline.

```python title="your_project/dagster/your_project/your_project/__init__.py" {7, 11}
import os
 
from dagster import Definitions
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource
 
from .dbt_assets import dbt_project_assets, dbt_project_dir
from .meltano import run_csv_to_iceberg_meltano_job
 
defs = Definitions(
    assets=[dbt_project_assets],
    jobs=[run_csv_to_iceberg_meltano_job],
    resources={
        "dbt": DbtCliResource(project_dir=os.fspath(dbt_project_dir)),
    },
)
```

If you follow the code to `run_csv_to_iceberg_meltano_job` function above, you'll see that we've added a Dagster job to run meltano.

```python title="your_project/dagster/your_project/meltano.py" {7, 11}
...

@job(resource_defs={"meltano": meltano_resource}, config=default_config)
def run_csv_to_iceberg_meltano_job():
    tap_done = meltano_run_op("tap-csv target-iceberg")()
```

As you can see here, this is simply running the Meltano CLI inside a Dagster job.

In the example project, this is all we've done, but for your own data pipeline, you can easily add scheduling on top of this job to run it daily or hourly.

Finally, let's run the Meltano ingestion job inside Dagster.

1. Go to the Dagster dashboard at http://localhost:3000 and click on the `run_csv_to_iceberg_meltano_job` job

![meltano-job-on-dagster](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/1a.jpg)

2. Go to the tab "Launchpad" and click "Launch Run".

![meltano-job-launch](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/1b.jpg)

You'll see the job starts running. It might take a couple of minutes to finish the ~100k rows of data we're using in our example project.

![meltano-job-run-success](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/1c.jpg)

If the job is run successfully, you'll see the 4 different tables written inside Minio's `raw` prefix (which maps to `raw` Trino schema). 

Check it out in Minio by going to http://localhost:9000 and logging in with the username `admin` and password `admin_secret`.

<MyAlert variant="info" title="Want to change the username/password for Minio?" description='To change the username and/or password for Minio, change the value of `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variables in the `minio` service section of the docker-compose.yaml file.' />

![raw-schema-on-minio](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/4.jpg)

### Inspecting the Iceberg Tables with Trino

Once the data is inserted to the Iceberg tables, you can inspect them from inside the Trino shell.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run trino shell" client:load />

Once you're in the Trino shell, first you need to switch to the `iceberg` catalog and `raw` schema. This basically tells Trino we're using the `raw` schema inside the Iceberg data store.

<BashCode code="use iceberg.raw;" client:load />

<MyAlert variant="info" title="Trino catalog?" description='Trino has a concept called "catalogs" (also called "connectors"). Each catalog is a data storage system that Trino can query. For example, Iceberg catalog or Snowflake catalog.' />

Then list out the tables in that schema.

<BashCode code="show tables;" client:load />

```plaintext
     Table     
---------------
 orders    
 customers 
 products
 stores  
(4 rows)
```

To view the data inside the table, you can run something like:

<BashCode code="select count(*) from orders;" client:load />

This will show you the number of rows in the `orders` table.

```plaintext
  _col0  
--------
 100000 
(1 row)
```

## Data Transformation

Now that we have the data in the Iceberg tables, we can start the transformation process to turn the raw data into a more useful form for analytics.

Above, we briefly showed you how we used our query engine Trino to query the data in the Iceberg tables.

Using the Trino shell directly is great for data exploration and ad hoc queries, but it's not suitable for an automated pipeline. For that, we connect DBT to Trino via the `dbt-trino` adapter so we can run our transformations inside Dagster (our orchestrator).

Now, let's see how we can set up dbt and Trino to work together.

Here's a quick reminder of where dbt and Trino are in the project structure.

```plaintext {5, 9}
your_project
├── .sidetrek
├── .venv
├── superset
├── trino
└── your_project
    ├── dagster
    ├── data
    ├── dbt
    └── meltano
```

### DBT + Trino

DBT is a SQL data transformation tool that follows software engineering best practices.

It makes it easy to write complex SQL queries, but it cannot execute those SQL queries itself. This is where Trino comes in. Trino is a query engine that can execute our DBT SQL queries.

DBT provides a Trino adapter (`dbt-trino`) that allows us to run our DBT transformations on Trino easily.

This Trino connection is configured in `dbt/your_project/profiles.yml`:

```yaml title="dbt/your_project/profiles.yml"
trino:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: trino
      user: trino
      host: localhost
      port: 8080
      database: iceberg
      schema: project
      http_scheme: http
      threads: 1
      session_properties:
        query_max_run_time: 5d
```

<MyAlert variant='info' title='Notice the `schema` of `project`' description='DBT creates schema names based on the `models` section of `dbt_project.yml`. For better control, we add `schema` in the root `profile.yml` which adds `project_` prefix to all schema names in this DBT project.' />

In `dbt/your_project/dbt_project.yml`, you'll see the project configuration.

```yaml title="dbt/your_project/dbt_project.yml" {3}
name: demo_project_32
version: 1.0.0
profile: trino
...
```

There's one more step required. We need to create the `raw` schema in Trino before we can run the DBT transformations.

We do this by adding the `on-run-start` hook inside `dbt/your_project/dbt_project.yml`.
  
```yaml title="dbt/your_project/dbt_project.yml" {3-4}
...
on-run-start:
  - CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS raw
  - CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS {{ schema }}
```

If you recall, it's the Trino schema where we loaded the data from Meltano. Recall this command we ran inside Trino shell:

<BashCode code="use iceberg.raw;" client:load />

We previously set up the loader to load the data into the `raw` schema in the `iceberg` catalog.

### Trino + Iceberg

Trino is a query engine (or "compute engine" to be more general). 

But query engines need to know where the data is stored. If you want to dig up gold (our data), you need both the shovel (the compute engine, which is Trino) and the gold deposit (the storage, which is Iceberg + Minio). 

In our case, the data is stored in Iceberg tables in Minio so we need to connect Trino with Iceberg somehow.

We've already set this up for you - if you look at the `trino` directory in the example project, you'll see the iceberg.properties file inside /trino/etc/catalog directory. This is the file that connects Trino with Iceberg.

To learn more about this, see the [Trino Iceberg connector documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/iceberg.html).

### Staging, Intermediate, and Marts

OK, now we've set up all the tools required to write our transformation queries in DBT.

We can start writing SQL queries in DBT now, but instead, let's take a look at a helpful organizational pattern: Staging, Intermediate, and Marts.

This is a common pattern in data warehousing where you have three layers of transformations, progressively turning raw data into a more business-conformed form suitable for analytics.

This pattern not only makes our SQL code more modular and maintainable but also makes it easier to collaborate with others. With a common design pattern like this, everyone knows exactly what to expect.

- **Staging**: This is where we create atomic tables from the raw data. You can think of each of these tables as the most basic unit of data — an atomic building block we'll later compose together to build more complex SQL queries. This makes our SQL code more modular.
- **Intermediate**: This is where we compose a bunch of atomic tables from the staging stage to create more complex tables. You can think of this stage as an intermediate step between the modular tables in the staging stage and the final, business-conformed tables in the marts stage.
- **Marts**: This is where you have the final, business-conformed data ready for analytics. Each mart is typically designed to be consumed by a specific function in the business, such as the finance team, marketing team, etc.

For more details, we highly recommend you check out DBT's excellent [Best Practices Guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview).

OK, now let's take a look at how we set up each stage in our example project.

### Staging

In `dbt/your_project/models` directory, you'll see the staging directory. 

Inside, you'll find `stg_iceberg.yml` where we specify the data sources for the staging tables as well as define the staging tables (or "models" in DBT terms) themselves.

```yaml title="dbt/your_project/models/staging/stg_iceberg.yml"
version: 2

sources:
  - name: stg_iceberg
    database: iceberg
    schema: raw
    tables:
      - name: orders
      - name: customers
      - name: products
      - name: stores

models:
  - name: stg_iceberg__orders
  - name: stg_iceberg__customers
  - name: stg_iceberg__products
  - name: stg_iceberg__stores
```

Notice how we've specified in DBT that the data `sources` are in the `iceberg` database and the `raw` schema. This is because we've set up Trino to connect to Iceberg tables in the `raw` schema.

In other words, `database` here maps to Trino `catalog`.

Staging tables are then defined under `models`.

<MyAlert variant="info" title="DBT file naming convention matters!" description="Note that we prefix all models with `stg` here. This denotes the stage. Then after a single underscore, there's `iceberg` which denotes the storage where the data lives. Finally we add the table name at the end after double underscores. A common naming convention like this makes it much easier to collaborate with others." />

#### Example DBT Model in Staging

We won't go through each table, but here's an example of a DBT model `stg_iceberg__orders`.

```sql title="dbt/your_project/models/staging/stg_iceberg__orders.sql"
{{
  config(
    file_format='iceberg',
    on_schema_change='sync_all_columns',
    materialized='incremental',
    incremental_strategy='merge',
    unique_key='order_id',
    properties={
      "format": "'PARQUET'",
      "sorted_by": "ARRAY['order_id']",
    }
  )
}}

with source as (
  select *, row_number() over (partition by id order by id desc) as row_num
  from {{ source('stg_iceberg', 'orders') }}
),

deduped_and_renamed as (
  select
    CAST(id AS VARCHAR) AS order_id,
    CAST(created_at AS TIMESTAMP) AS order_created_at,
    CAST(qty AS DECIMAL) AS qty,
    CAST(product_id AS VARCHAR) AS product_id,
    CAST(customer_id AS VARCHAR) AS customer_id,
    CAST(store_id AS VARCHAR) AS store_id
  from source
  where row_num = 1
)

select * from deduped_and_renamed
```

I'm sure you recognize the SQL queries here. The part you might not be familiar with is the `config` block at the top.

This is actually a Jinja template that DBT uses to augment SQL code. In this case, we're telling DBT how to materialize this model.

When we run DBT build, it will take this code and create a valid SQL query that can be executed by Trino.

<MyAlert variant="info" title="Deduplication of Tables" description="In the project_staging schema, the table stg_iceberg__orders undergoes a deduplication process to ensure each order_id remains unique. This process involves grouping rows by order_id, using row numbering, and retaining only one row from each group. By eliminating duplicate entries, we maintain data integrity and streamline data processing workflows. This approach ensures that our staging environment accurately reflects unique order information, aligning with data quality standards and enhancing the reliability of downstream analytics and reporting." />

#### Adding Staging Model Configuration to `dbt_project.yml`

Finally, we need to add a bit of extra configuration. We do this in the `dbt_project.yml` file in the `dbt` directory.

```yaml title="dbt/your_project/dbt_project.yml" {4-7} showLineNumbers
...
models:
  your_project:
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: staging
      +views_enabled: false
...
```

#### Deduping

There's one more thing we should go over: deduping.

Because `target-iceberg` currently only supports APPEND operation, you will probably want to dedupe the data during the `staging` stage of the DBT transformation. 

This way you can make sure the ingestion process is idempotent (i.e. you can run it multiple times with the same result). 

There are many ways to dedupe your data here, but let's see how we did it in the example project.

Before we get to the code, let's enter the Trino shell and see how many rows are in the raw `orders` table (i.e. ingested frmo Meltano before any transformation).

<BashCode code="sidetrek run trino shell" client:load />

<BashCode code="select count(*) from iceberg.raw.orders;" client:load />

You'll see that we have 100k rows in the raw `orders` table as expected (since our source `orders.csv` has 100k rows). 

```plaintext
_col0  
---------
 1000000 
(1 row)
```

Once we run the `staging` DBT models, we can see that `stg_iceberg__orders` table also has 100k rows as expected.

<BashCode code="select count(*) from iceberg.project_staging.stg_iceberg__orders;" client:load />

The output should be:

```plaintext
 _col0  
---------
 1000000 
(1 row)
```

Now, if we run the Meltano ingestion job AGAIN in Dagster, we'll see that the `orders` table in Trino will have 200k rows. This is because `target-iceberg` APPENDs the data.

<BashCode code="select count(*) from iceberg.raw.orders;" client:load />

You should see:

```plaintext
_col0  
---------
 2000000 
(1 row)
```

Clearly we don't want this to happen in our staging model since we don't want any duplicate data.

To dedupe the data, we add the `row_num` column to the source raw `orders` table by using the `row_number()` function in the `stg_iceberg__orders` model.

```sql title="dbt/your_project/models/staging/stg_iceberg__orders.sql" {4, 17}
...

with source as (
  select *, row_number() over (partition by id order by id desc) as row_num
  from {{ source('stg_iceberg', 'orders') }}
),

deduped_and_renamed as (
  select
    CAST(id AS VARCHAR) AS order_id,
    CAST(created_at AS TIMESTAMP) AS order_created_at,
    CAST(qty AS DECIMAL) AS qty,
    CAST(product_id AS VARCHAR) AS product_id,
    CAST(customer_id AS VARCHAR) AS customer_id,
    CAST(store_id AS VARCHAR) AS store_id
  from source
  where row_num = 1
)

select * from deduped_and_renamed
```

This code adds a row number to duplicate rows based on `id` field. For example, if we have two rows with the same `id`, the row with the higher `id` will have `row_num` of 1 and the other will have `row_num` of 2. 

```plaintext {2-3}
id | row_num
1 | 1
1 | 2
2 | 1
3 | 1
```

Then in `deduped_and_renamed` CTE, we only select rows where `row_num` is 1. This effectively dedupes the data.

Now if you go back to the Trino shell and run the query to see the number of rows in the `stg_iceberg__orders` table, you'll see that it's still only 100k.

<BashCode code="select count(*) from iceberg.project_staging.stg_iceberg__orders;" client:load />

The output should be:

```plaintext
 _col0  
---------
 1000000 
(1 row)
```

We can do this for all tables in the staging area to make sure our ingestion process is idempotent at the `staging` stage.

### Intermediate

Similar to the staging stage, we have the intermediate stage in the `dbt/your_project/models/intermediate` directory.

As with staging, you'll notice we specify the sources and models in the `int_iceberg.yml` file.

```yaml title="dbt/your_project/models/intermediate/int_iceberg.yml"
version: 2

sources:
  - name: int_iceberg
    database: iceberg
    schema: project_staging
    tables:
      - name: stg_iceberg__orders
      - name: stg_iceberg__customers
      - name: stg_iceberg__products
      - name: stg_iceberg__stores

models:
  - name: int_iceberg__denormalized_orders
```

Then we add the model SQL file `int_iceberg__denormalized_orders.sql`.

```sql title="dbt/your_project/models/intermediate/int_iceberg__denormalized_orders.sql"
{{
config(
  file_format='iceberg',
  materialized='incremental',
  on_schema_change='sync_all_columns',
  unique_key='order_id',
  incremental_strategy='merge',
  properties={
  "format": "'PARQUET'",
  "sorted_by": "ARRAY['order_id']",
  "partitioning": "ARRAY['device_type']",
  }
)
}}

with denormalized_data as (
  select
    o.order_id,
    o.order_created_at,
    o.qty,
    o.product_id,
    o.customer_id,
    o.store_id,
    c.acc_created_at,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    --  Concatenated columns
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) as full_name,
    c.gender,
    c.country,
    c.address,
    c.phone,
    c.email,
    c.payment_method,
    c.traffic_source,
    c.referrer,
    c.customer_age,
    c.device_type,
    p.name as product_name,
    p.category as product_category,
    (p.price/100) as product_price,
    p.description as product_description,
    p.unit_shipping_cost,
    s.name as store_name,
    s.city as store_city,
    s.state as store_state,
    s.tax_rate,
    -- Calculated columns
    (p.price/100) * o.qty as total_product_price,
    ((p.price/100) * o.qty) + p.unit_shipping_cost as total_price_with_shipping,
    (((p.price/100) * o.qty) + p.unit_shipping_cost) * (1 + s.tax_rate) as total_price_with_tax
  from {{ ref('stg_iceberg__orders') }} o
  left join {{ ref('stg_iceberg__customers') }} c
    on o.customer_id = c.id
  left join {{ ref('stg_iceberg__products') }} p
    on o.product_id = p.id
  left join {{ ref('stg_iceberg__stores') }} s
    on o.store_id = s.id
)

select *
from denormalized_data
```

Finally in dbt/dbt_project.yml, we add the configuration for the intermediate stage.

```yaml title="dbt/your_project/dbt_project.yml" {8-11} showLineNumbers
...
models:
  your_project:
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: staging
      +views_enabled: false
    intermediate:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: intermediate
      +views_enabled: false
...
```

### Marts

Same deal with marts. We have the `dbt/your_project/models/marts` directory where we specify the sources and models in the `mart_iceberg.yml` file.

```yaml title="dbt/your_project/models/marts/marts_iceberg.yml"
version: 2

sources:
  - name: marts_iceberg
    database: iceberg
    schema: project_intermediate
    tables:
      - name: int_iceberg__denormalized_orders

models:
  - name: marts_iceberg__general
  - name: marts_iceberg__marketing
  - name: marts_iceberg__payment
```

<MyAlert variant="info" title="Take note of the Marts naming convention." description="Each mart table is typically built for a specific audience. For example, `marts_iceberg__marketing` is for the marketing team." />

Then we add the model SQL files. We'll skip an example here, but you get the idea.

Finally, we add the configuration for the marts stage in `dbt/dbt_project.yml`.

```yaml title="dbt/your_project/dbt_project.yml" {12-15} showLineNumbers
...
models:
  your_project:
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: staging
      +views_enabled: false
    intermediate:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: intermediate
      +views_enabled: false
    marts:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: marts
      +views_enabled: false
...
```

### Running DBT Transformations in Dagster

Now that we have the DBT transformations set up, let's see how we can run them in Dagster.

Dagster has a deep DBT integration. It can infer the dependencies between all your DBT models and run them in the correct order. The visualization of this graph is also very helpful.

![dbt-assets-dagster](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/7a.jpg)

We add all DBT assets into Dagster in `dagster/your_project/your_project/dbt_assets.py`.

```python title="your_project/dagster/your_project/your_project/__init__.py"
...
@dbt_assets(manifest=dbt_manifest_path)
def dbt_project_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

In the code above, we're using the `dagster_dbt` package, which the Dagster team created to build DBT assets and then import them as Dagster assets.

Once we've done that, we can add the DBT assets to the Dagster definitions in `dagster/your_project/your_project/__init__.py`.

```python title="your_project/dagster/your_project/your_project/__init__.py" {4, 6, 10, 12-14}
import os
 
from dagster import Definitions
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource
 
from .dbt_assets import dbt_project_assets, dbt_project_dir
from .meltano import run_csv_to_iceberg_meltano_job
 
defs = Definitions(
    assets=[dbt_project_assets],
    jobs=[run_csv_to_iceberg_meltano_job],
    resources={
        "dbt": DbtCliResource(project_dir=os.fspath(dbt_project_dir)),
    },
)
```

Now you should be able to see all DBT assets in Global Asset Lineage section of the Dagster dashboard:

1. Click on the "Assets" in the top menu.
2. Click on "View global asset lineage" at the top right.

![dbt-assets-lineage-dagster](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/8a.jpg)

In the global asset lineage view, click "Materialize all" to execute the DBT transformations (underneath, Trino is executing these DBT queries). Of course, in a production environment, you might want to schedule them instead of manually triggering them.

![dbt-assets-lineage-dagster](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/8b.jpg)

If the materialization was successful, you should see 3 analytics-ready tables in `project_marts` prefix in minio.

![marts-tables-minio](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/10.jpg)

## Data Visualization

OK, we have the data in the form we want for analytics! 

Now we can visualize them using a tool like Superset.

We know that Data Analysts are particular about which tool they use here. So we've separated out Superset in its own directory so it can be easily replaced by another tool of your choice.

```plaintext {4}
your_project
├── .sidetrek
├── .venv
├── superset
├── trino
└── your_project
    ├── dagster
    ├── data
    ├── dbt
    └── meltano
```

Let's configure Superset to connect to Trino and visualize the data.

### Superset + Trino

Go to the Superset dashboard at http://localhost:8088 and log in with the username `admin` and password `admin`.

You can change the username and password in the `docker-init.sh` file inside the `superset/docker` directory:

```plaintext title="superset/docker/docker-init.sh" {2, 7}
...
ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin"
...
# Create an admin user
echo_step "2" "Starting" "Setting up admin user ( admin / $ADMIN_PASSWORD )"
superset fab create-admin \
              --username admin \
              --firstname Superset \
              --lastname Admin \
              --email admin@superset.com \
              --password $ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

### Adding Trino as a Database Connection in Superset

Now we need to add Trino as a database connection in Superset.

1. Go to the "Settings" dropdown at the top right corner and click "Database Connections".

![superset-database-connections](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/11a.jpg)

2. Click on the "+Database" button at the top right corner.

![superset-add-database](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/11b.jpg)

3. Find "Trino" option in the "SUPPORTED DATABASES" select field near the bottom.

![superset-trino](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/11c.jpg)

4. In the "SQLALCHEMY URI" field, enter `trino://trino@host.docker.internal:8080/iceberg` and then click "Connect".

![superset-trino-uri](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/11d.jpg)

Trino should now be connected to Superset.

### Adding an Example Dashboard

Now that we've connected Superset to Trino, let's add an example dashboard.

1. First download the example dashboard we created for you [here](https://docs.sidetrek.com/superset/demo_dashboard.zip).
2. Go to the "Dashboards" tab and click on the Import Dashboard icon at the top-right corner.

![superset-import-module](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/12a.jpg)

3. Upload the downloaded zip file and click "Import".

![superset-import-module](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/12b.jpg)

4. Find the example dashboard you just added in the list of dashboards and click on it to view it.

![superset-dashboard-list](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/12c.jpg)

That's it! You should now see a bunch of charts we created for you based on the example dataset.

![superset-dashboard-view](@/assets/docs/step-4-explore-example/12d.jpg)

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've just built an end-to-end data pipeline from scratch.

This is a simple example, but it's a great starting point for building more complex data pipelines.
