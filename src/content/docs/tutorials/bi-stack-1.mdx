# BI Stack Example Project

<SubH1>Let's see what we can do with the data pipeline you just created by exploring the example project.</SubH1>

If you opted in to adding the example project during `sidetrek init`, you should now have a fully functional data pipeline that you can explore.

Let's take a look at each part of this example project to see what's going on.

## The Dataset

We've included a simple dataset with four tables: `orders`, `customers`, `products`, and `stores`. This emulates the typical e-commerce data for simplicity.

Each table has its own csv file in the `/your_project/data` directory.
