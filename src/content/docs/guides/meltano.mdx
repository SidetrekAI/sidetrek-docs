# Meltano

Meltano is an ingestion tool that makes it easy to ingest from hundreds of data sources using pre-built connectors. Essentially, it handles the EL ("Extract, Load") part of the ELT process.

The reason we favor Meltano over other managed connectors is that it is open-source and it's CLI based rather than UI based. Primarily UI based tools are not easy to automate and we believe automation is an important part of a robust data pipeline.

## Meltano CLI

In Sidetrek, Meltano is already integrated with Dagster and you can trigger Meltano ingestion jobs from Dagster (or schedule it).

This is great for production automation, but often, you might want to use Meltano directly using CLI - for testing and debugging, for example.

It's faster and also in case of issues, easier to debug because you don't have to try and figure out if the error is from Meltano or from Dagster.

You can run any `meltano` CLI commands using `sidetrek run` in the project root:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano --version" client:load />

It should show you the version of meltano installed.

```plaintext
meltano, version 3.4.2
```

All `sidetrek run` is doing underneath is running Meltano CLI within the right directory (`meltano` command must be run inside meltano project directory) and wrapping the command with `poetry run` so it's in the right vitrual env.

So it's identical to running:

<BashCode code="cd your_project/meltano && poetry run meltano --version" client:load />

You can run any `meltano` command using `sidetrek run meltano`:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano run tap-csv target-iceberg" client:load />

## Installing Meltano Taps and Targets

To use Meltano to ingest data, you need to set up two things: 1) an extractor ("tap") and 2) a loader ("target").

<MyAlert variant="info" title="Taps and Targets?" description='Meltano follows the Singer protocol for their extractors and loaders. In the Singer protocol, extractors are called "taps" and loaders are called "targets".' />

For example, to ingest data from a CSV file to Postgres, you can use the `tap-csv` to extract data from any CSV files and `target-postgres` to load the extracted data into Postgres tables.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano add extractor tap-csv" client:load />

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano add loader target-postgres" client:load />
 
If multiple variants of a discoverable plugin are available, you can choose a specific (non-default) variant using the `--variant` option on `meltano add`:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano add loader target-postgres --variant=transferwise" client:load />

## Installing Custom Taps or Targets

Custom plugins for packages can be added to your project using the `--custom`:

For example, in our example we have a custom loader for Iceberg called `target-iceberg` because there's no official loader for Iceberg yet. You can install a custom target like this:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano add --custom loader target-iceberg" client:load />

## Configuring Taps or Targets

Once the `taps` and `targets` are installed, we need to configure them. You can set the configuration settings for a plugin using the `meltano config` command.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano config target-postgres set password my_password" client:load />

You can also use `--interactive` flag instead:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano config --interactive" client:load />

Running this will show you a list of all configurations.

Finally, you can alternatively add the configuration settings in the `meltano.yml` file in your project directory.

```yaml title="meltano/meltano.yml"
...
plugins:
  extractors:
    - name: tap-csv
      variant: meltanolabs
      pip_url: git+https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-csv.git
      config:
        csv_files_definition: extract/example_csv_files_def.json
  loaders:
  ...
```

If you change anything directly in the `meltano.yml` file, you need to run `meltano install` to apply the changes.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano install" client:load />

This will install all the `taps` and `targets` specified in the `meltano.yml` file. If you've installed them already, it'll simply use the cached version.

Sometimes you want to make sure you re-install them from scratch. You can do that using the `--clean` flag:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano install --clean" client:load />

If you have a lot of `taps` and `targets`, you probably don't want to have to reinstall everything, so you can update a specific tap or target like this:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano install --clean extractor tap-csv" client:load />

Or for a target:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano install --clean loader target-postgres" client:load />

## Explicit Inheritance

Sometimes you want to use the same plugin with multiple different configurations. 

You can do so using explicit inheritance. Essentially, you're creating a new plugin that inherits from an existing plugin.

For example, to create a variation of `tap-postgres` called `tap-postgres--billing`, you can use the `--inherit-from` flag:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano add extractor tap-postgres--billing --inherit-from tap-postgres" client:load />

The corresponding inheriting plugin definition in your `meltano.yml` project file  will have an `inherit_from` field to specify the parent plugin.

```yaml title="example-project>/meltano/meltano.yml"
...
plugins:
  extractors:
  - name: tap-postgres--billing
    inherit_from: tap-postgres
    variant: transferwise
    pip_url: pipelinewise-tap-postgres
...
```

## Updating plugins

You can update a plugin in your project using the `--update` option. Updating a plugin will re-add it to your project. This will do two things:

- Update the plugin lock file the same as `meltano lock --update` would
- Update the plugin entry in the `meltano.yml`, without overwriting any user-defined config or extras

For example, this will update the `tap-gitlab` extractor without changing any of the existing configurations:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run meltano add --update extractor tap-gitlab" client:load />
