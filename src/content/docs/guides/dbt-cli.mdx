# DBT Using CLI

If you want to use DBT directly using CLI, instead of the Dagster UI, you can do so, by running:

```bash
cd <example-project>/<example-project>/dbt/<example-project>
poetry run dbt --version
```

### Running All Models

You can directly run DBT models using CLI:

```bash
poetry run dbt run
```
### Running A Specific Model

To run a specific model or a list of models, you can use the `--select` flag:

```bash
poetry run dbt run --select <model-name>
# For example:
poetry run dbt run --select marts_iceberg__general
```
### Running A Set of Models

If you want to run a set of models with names starting with `stg_iceberg__`, such as, `stg_iceberg__products`, `stg_iceberg__orders`, etc., you can use the `--select` flag with `+`:

```bash
poetry run dbt run --select +stg_iceberg__
```
### Excluding A Model or A List of Models
You can also exclude a specific model or a list of models using the `--exclude` flag:

```bash
poetry run dbt run --exclude <model-name>
# For example:
poetry run dbt run --exclude int_iceberg__denormalized_orders
```
