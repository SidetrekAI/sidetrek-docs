# Directives

## What are Directives?

Directives are special comments that start with `#|` you can add to the top* of the cell to tell Sidetrek how to run the cell **at the build time**.

The important part here is to understand that directives don't do anything when you run the cell. It's only used during build time.

For example, `#| export` is a directive that tells Sidetrek to export the cells with the directive to a Python module. All cells in a notebook marked with this directive will be aggregated into a single Python module.

When you run `sidetrek notebook export` (i.e. at build time), it will export the notebooks as Python modules. This way, there's no need to duplicate code for production! You could just run this as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

## #| export

The `#| export` directive tells Sidetrek to export the cells with the directive as a Python module. 

All cells in a notebook marked with this directive will be aggregated into a single DBT model.

You need to add `#| default_exp` directive to a separate cell at the top of the notebook to specify the module name.

### Usage

In the top cell of your notebook, you could have:

```plaintext
#| default_exp my_module
```

In cell #1, you could have some Python code:

```python
#| export
print('Hello, world!')
```

In cell #2, you could have some more Python code:

```python
#| export
print('Goodbye, world!')
```

When you run `sidetrek notebook export`, cell #1 and cell #2 will now be exported as a single Python module named `my_module` and saved as `my_module.py` in the same directory as the notebook.

## #| export_dbt

The `#| export_dbt` directive tells Sidetrek to export the cells with the directive to a DBT model. 

Each cell with this directive will be exported as a separate `.sql` file.

### Usage

Let's say you have a notebook named stg_iceberg__your_model.ipynb. 

In cell #1, you could have some DBT code:

```plaintext
%%writefile_dbt your_model.sql
#| export_dbt your_model.sql

with source as (
  select * from {{ ref('raw_orders') }}
)

renamed as (
  select
    id as order_id,
    user_id as customer_id,
    order_date,
  from source
)

select * from renamed
```

When you run `sidetrek notebook export`, cell #1 will now be exported as a `stg_iceberg__your_model.sql` DBT file in the same directory as your notebook.

We need magic at the top here too since during development (i.e. while you're locally experimenting), we want to still generate the DBT files so we can run them and inspect the results. Remember, the `#| export_*` directives are only executed when you run `sidetrek notebook export` during the build time.

One caveat: magic command always need to be at the top of the cell - so it has to be above the directive if both magic and directives are used in the same cell.
