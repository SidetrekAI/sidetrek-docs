# Magics

## What are Magics?

Magics are special commands that start with `%` (line magic) or `%%` (cell magic) you can add to the top* of the cell to tell Jupyter how to run the cell. 

There are few built-in [magics](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) but you can also create a custom one, which is what Sidetrek is doing to enable the DBT notebook. 

For example, `%%writefile_dbt` is a custom magic that writes the cell content to a file with the `.sql` extension without executing the cell (which would cause an error since `code` cells in Jupyter executes with Python and does not understand DBT).

This allows us to run the generated `.sql` files using the Sidetrek CLI. You can use either Dagster or DBT via Sidetrek CLI to run the generated DBT files.

## %%writefile_dbt

The `%%writefile_dbt` magic writes the cell content to a file with the `.sql` extension without executing the cell.

### Usage

In cell #1, you could have some DBT code:

```plaintext
%%writefile_dbt my_table.sql
select * from my_table
```

And in cell #2, you could run the following command to execute the DBT code:

```plaintext
sidetrek run dbt run my_table.sql
```

Then in cell #3, you could query it:

```python
conn = trino.connect(catalog="iceberg", schema="project_staging")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM stg_iceberg__your_model LIMIT 10")
rows = cur.fetchall()
```

Once you have the data, you could analyze it with something like `pandas` if you'd like:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
print(df.head(5))
```
