# Jupyter Notebooks

Sidetrek ships with Jupyter Lab (IDE for Jupyter Notebooks). If you're not familiar with Jupyter Notebook, it's a great way to do "literate programming" where you can write code, add text, and visualize data all in one place.

It's very popular among data scientists and analysts for enabling fast experimentation and we believe it could be very valuable for data engineers as well. It's a great platform for working with data in general because you can easily visualize data as you write code.

If you're new to Jupyter Notebooks, you can learn more about them in the [official documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation).

## How to Run Jupyter Lab

If you run `sidetrek start` to start the Sidetrek services, Jupyter Lab will be available at [http://localhost:8889/lab](http://localhost:8889/lab).

## Create a New Notebook

You can create a new Jupyter Notebook directly inside the Jupyter Lab interface, but you can also create them using the following command:

<BashCode code="sidetrek notebook new" client:load />

Why have a CLI command for creating a blank notebook? For a blank notebook, this is not very useful, but it's very useful for creating a DBT notebook.

When you run the above command and select the DBT option, it will create a new Jupyter notebook with the DBT code template.

You simply have to write the DBT code in the right Notebook cell to run and visualize the data.
 
We think Jupyter Notebook provides an interesting alternative to Vscode, more iterative way to work with DBT.

See more details in the [DBT Notebook](/docs/guides/jupyter-notebook/dbt) documentation.

## Types of Jupyter Notebooks

There are two types of Jupyter notebooks you can create with Sidetrek:

1. **Python Notebook** - A blank Python notebook where you can write Python code.
2. **DBT Notebook** - A Jupyter notebook with the DBT code template.

The DBT notebook is a great way to work with DBT as you can write the DBT code in the notebook cells and run them to see the results right away.

## Magics and Directives

DBT notebook is made possible by two concepts that you may not be familiar with: 1) magics and 2) directives.

Magics and directives imbue notebooks with special powers that allow you to do things like export the notebook as a Python module or a DBT model.

See [Jupyter Notebook Magics](/docs/guides/jupyter-notebook/magics) and [Jupyter Notebook Directives](/docs/guides/jupyter-notebook/directives) for more details.

## Exporting Notebooks

Jupyter notebook is awesome for experimentation, but one of its main drawbacks has been that you have to duplicate the code as a Python file when it comes time to use the code in production.

Sidetrek solves this problem by allowing you to export the notebooks as Python modules or DBT models via [directives](/docs/guides/jupyter-notebook/directives).

First you need to add the directives to the cells you want to export:

- Add `#| export` directive to cells you want to export as Python modules. 
- Add the `#| export_dbt` directive to cells you want to export as DBT models.

Once directives are added, you can export the notebooks as Python modules or DBT models with a single command at build time:

<BashCode code="sidetrek notebook export" client:load />

This way, you can do all your development in Jupyter notebooks and export them as Python modules or DBT models when you're ready to run them in production - as part of your CI/CD pipeline, for example.

For more details, see [Jupyter Notebook Directives](/docs/guides/jupyter-notebook/directives) documentation.
