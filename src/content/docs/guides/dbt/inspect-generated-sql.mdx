# How to Inspect DBT Generated SQL

Everytime you run DBT, it takes the models you wrote and generates the SQL code that can be executed.

Often, during debugging for example, you want to inspect this generated SQL code.

## Compile DBT Models

You can inspect DBT generated SQL without actually running the models by using the `dbt compile` command.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt compile" client:load />

`dbt compile` generates executable SQL from source model, test, and analysis files without actually running the models and materializing them in the data store. 

You can find these compiled SQL files in the `dbt/your_project/target` directory of your dbt project.

```plaintext
dbt
└── your_project
    └── target
        ├── dbt_project_assets-5d86fc8-f7e8d65
        │   ├── compiled
        │   │   └── your_project
        │   │       ├── models
        │   │       └── ...
        │   └── run
        │       └── your_project
        │           ├── models
        │           └── ...
        └── dbt.log
```

Inside the "target" directory, you'll see the `compiled` directory where you can find the compiled SQL files.

If you run the models instead of compiling them, you can find the executed SQL files in the `run` directory.
