# DBT

DBT is a data transformation tool that makes it easy to transform data in your warehouse. It's a popular tool among data engineers because it's SQL-based and easy to use.

Dagster integrates nicely with DBT and can infer DBT transformation dependencies. You can run DBT models directly from the Dagster UI or schedule them.

## DBT CLI

But sometimes it's useful to run DBT directly using CLI - for testing and debugging, for example. 

It's faster and also in case of issues, easier to debug because you don't have to try and figure out if the error is from DBT or from Dagster.

You can run DBT CLI commands using `sidetrek run` in the project root:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt --version" client:load />

All `sidetrek run` is doing underneath is running DBT CLI within the right directory (`dbt` command should be run inside dbt project directory) and wrapping the command with `poetry run` so it's in the right vitrual env.

So it's identical to running:

<BashCode code="cd your_project/dbt/your_project && poetry run dbt --version" client:load />

You can run any `dbt` command using `sidetrek run dbt`:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt run" client:load />

## Running DBT Models

You can run all DBT models via DBT CLI using the following command:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt run" client:load />

### Running A Specific Model

To run a specific model, you can use the `--select` flag. 

For example, to run a model named `marts_iceberg__general`, you can use the following command:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt run --select marts_iceberg__general" client:load />

### Running A Set of Models

If you want to run a set of models with names starting with `stg_` such as `stg_iceberg__products`, `stg_iceberg__orders`, etc., you can use the `--select` flag with `+`:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt run --select +stg_>" client:load />

This is useful for example when you want to run all staging models.

### Excluding A Model

You can also exclude a specific model or a list of models using the `--exclude` flag.

For example, you can run all models except `int_iceberg__denormalized_orders` model using the following command:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt run --exclude int_iceberg__denormalized_orders" client:load />
