## Trino CLI

You can use Trino CLI to query your Iceberg tables. In your console, run the following:

```bash
docker exec -it trino trino
```

When you see `trino>`, it means you are inside Trino CLI.

Run the following SQL query to check all the catalogs you have:

```bash
show catalogs;
```

You’ll see the names of the catalogs in Trino:

```bash
 Catalog 
---------
 iceberg 
 system  
(2 rows)

Query 20240515_235950_00029_ky8ah, FINISHED, 1 node
Splits: 11 total, 11 done (100.00%)
0.17 [0 rows, 0B] [0 rows/s, 0B/s]
```

Similarly, you can check all the schemas inside `iceberg` catalog by running this:

```bash
show schemas in iceberg;
```

You’ll see the names of all existing schemas.

Let’s query the number of rows in the table `int_iceberg__denormalized_orders` in the schema `project_intermediate` in the catalog `iceberg`. Run the following:

```bash
select count(*) from iceberg.project_intermediate.int_iceberg__denormalized_orders;
```

You’ll see the output:

```bash
 _col0  
---------
 1000000 
(1 row)

Query 20240516_000541_00003_ky8ah, FINISHED, 1 node
Splits: 26 total, 26 done (100.00%)
0.28 [1000K rows, 720KB] [3.57M rows/s, 2.51MB/s]
```
