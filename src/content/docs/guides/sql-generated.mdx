If you want to check the SQL code generated from your DBT models, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
cd <example-project>/<example-project>/dbt/<example-project>
poetry run dbt compile
```
`dbt compile` generates executable SQL from source model, test, and analysis files. You can find these compiled SQL files in the `target/` directory of your dbt project.
