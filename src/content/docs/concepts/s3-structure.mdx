# Understanding S3 File Structure

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service designed for storing and retrieving any amount of data at any time. It uses a simple and flexible structure that allows users to store and organize their data efficiently. The structure of S3 is straightforward, focusing on buckets, objects, and keys. MinIO is an open-source, high-performance, distributed object storage system designed to be compatible with Amazon S3's API. This compatibility allows MinIO to serve as an alternative to S3 for on-premises or private cloud environments. The structure of MinIO mirrors that of S3, providing a familiar setup for users who are already acquainted with Amazon S3.

## Key Components of S3

1. **Bucket**:
    - **Description**: The top-level container for storing objects in S3. Each bucket must have a globally unique name and is created in a specific AWS region.
    - **Role**: Acts as a namespace for objects and organizes them within the S3 service.
2. **Object**:
    - **Description**: The fundamental entity stored in a bucket, consisting of the data itself and metadata.
    - **Role**: Represents the actual data stored in S3. Objects are identified within a bucket by a unique key.
3. **Key**:
    - **Description**: The unique identifier for an object within a bucket. It is essentially the "name" of the object.
    - **Role**: Used to retrieve and manage objects. Keys can include slashes (**`/`**) to simulate a hierarchical directory structure, though S3 uses a flat namespace.
4. **Metadata**:
    - **Description**: Information about the object, such as its size, type, and other properties. Metadata can be system-defined (e.g., creation date, last modified date) or user-defined (custom metadata).
    - **Role**: Provides additional context and information about the object, useful for managing and retrieving the data.

### Example Structure of S3

Let's consider a scenario where we have a bucket named `lakehouse` containing several objects:

- **Bucket**: `lakehouse`
    - **Object**: `/raw/orders/data/00000-0-2cd2668b-2b7a-4dac-8a1e-af3f02fa2495.parquet`
        - **Key**: `/raw/orders/data/00000-0-2cd2668b-2b7a-4dac-8a1e-af3f02fa2495.parquet`
        - **Metadata**: `{ "Name": "00000-0-2cd2668b-2b7a-4dac-8a1e-af3f02fa2495.parquet", "Date": "2024-05-26 17:35:45 UTC", “Size”: “189 KiB”, “ETag”: “edd2116fab95a1381e9ad50fb03c012a-1”, “Type”: “file” }`

You can check the metadata of a file stored in Minio using MinIO Client (mc):

```bash
docker exec -it mc bash
mc stat minio/<lakehouse-name>/<catalog-name>/<namespace>/data/<key-name>
# For example
mc stat minio/lakehouse/raw/orders/data/00000-0-2cd2668b-2b7a-4dac-8a1e-af3f02fa2495.parquet
```

You should see the metadata:

```plaintext
Name      : 00000-0-2cd2668b-2b7a-4dac-8a1e-af3f02fa2495.parquet
Date      : 2024-05-26 17:35:45 UTC 
Size      : 189 KiB 
ETag      : edd2116fab95a1381e9ad50fb03c012a-1 
Type      : file 
Metadata  :
  Content-Type: application/octet-stream 
```
