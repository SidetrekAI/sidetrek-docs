# Comparison of Database Structures

This table provides a quick reference to the structural terminology and hierarchy for different database systems.

| Database | Top Level | Middle Level | Bottom Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | Database | Schema | Table |
| MySQL | Database | - | Table |
| Trino | Catalog | Schema | Table |
| Iceberg | Catalog | Namespace | Table |
| MongoDB | Database | Collection | Document |
| Oracle | Database | Schema | Table |
| SQL Server | Database | Schema | Table |
| Cassandra | Keyspace | - | Table |
| Redis | Database | - | Key-Value |
| S3 | Bucket | - | Object |
| DuckDB | Database | Schema | Table |

## How to Access Trino Database
You can use Trino CLI to access Trino database. Here is an example of how to access Trino CLI:

<BashCode code="sidetrek run trino shell" client:load />

You'll see `trino>` at the beginning of the line on your console. You can run SQL queries here.
<BashCode code="show catalogs;" client:load />

It will show all the available catalogs in Trino. Run this command to see all the available schemas under a catalog.
<BashCode code="show schemas from catalog_name;" client:load />

It will show all the schemas under the catalog. You can also run SQL queries to show the tables in the schema.
<BashCode code="trino> use catalog_name.schema_name;" client:load />

It will switch to the schema. Run this command to see all the tables in the schema.
<BashCode code="trino:schema_name> show tables;" client:load />

It will show all the tables in the schema. You can run SQL queries to see the data in the tables.
<BashCode code="trino:schema_name> select * from table_name;" client:load />

It will show all the data in the table.

## How to Access PostgreSQL Database
There are two main ways to access data in PostgreSQL:

1. **Using psql:** This is the command-line interface for PostgreSQL. You can use psql to connect to a database, run SQL queries to retrieve data, and even update or delete data.

2. **Using a graphical user interface (GUI) tool:** There are several GUI tools available for PostgreSQL, such as pgAdmin. These tools allow you to manage your databases and run SQL queries in a more user-friendly way.

You can access the PostgreSQL database from inside a container using the following command:
<BashCode code="docker exec -it postgres-container psql -U postgres" client:load />

You'll see `postgres=#` at the beginning of the line on your console. You can run SQL queries here.
<BashCode code="postgres=# \l" client:load />

It will show all the available databases in PostgreSQL. You can always press `q` to come back to the original psql cli. Run this command to connect to a database.
<BashCode code="postgres=# \c db_name" client:load />

Run this command to see all the available schemas under a database.
<BashCode code="db_name=# \dn" client:load />

It will show all the schemas under the database. You can also run SQL queries to show the tables in the schema.
<BashCode code="postgres=# \dt schema_name.*" client:load />

It will show all the tables in the schema. You can run SQL queries to see the data in the tables.
<BashCode code="postgres=# select * from schema_name.table_name;" client:load />

It will show all the data in the table.
