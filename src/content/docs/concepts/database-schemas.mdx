# Comparison of Database/Schema Terminologies

Every database system has its own terminology and hierarchy to organize data. 

Because there are many types of databases, it can be confusing to understand the structure of each one and how they compare.

<MyAlert variant="info" title="Not all of these are databases" description="Some of the databases listed below are not technically databases at all. Trino, for example, is a query engine, not a database. But we'll include them here because understanding these terminologies are important for data querying." />

This table provides a quick reference to the terminology and hierarchy for different database systems.

| Database | Top Level | Middle Level | Bottom Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | Database | Schema | Table |
| MySQL | Database | - | Table |
| Trino | Catalog | Schema | Table |
| Iceberg | Catalog | Namespace | Table |
| MongoDB | Database | Collection | Document |
| Oracle | Database | Schema | Table |
| SQL Server | Database | Schema | Table |
| Cassandra | Keyspace | - | Table |
| Redis | Database | - | Key-Value |
| S3 | Bucket | - | Object |
| DuckDB | Database | Schema | Table |

## Example 1 - Querying Postgres

Since most data engineers are familiar with SQL databases, let's take Postgres as an example.

There are many ways to access a Postgres database, but for simplicity, we'll use the `psql` command line tool.

You can access the Postgres database from inside a container using the following command:

<BashCode code="docker exec -it postgres-container psql -U postgres" client:load />

You'll see `postgres=#` at the beginning of the line on your console. You can run Postgres queries here.

Let's see what databases are available in our Postgres instance.

<BashCode code="postgres=# \l" client:load />

It will show all the available databases in PostgreSQL. You can always press `q` to come back to the original psql cli. Run this command to connect to a database.

<BashCode code="postgres=# \c db_name" client:load />

Run this command to see all the available schemas under a database.

<BashCode code="db_name=# \dn" client:load />

It will show all the schemas under the database. You can also run SQL queries to show the tables in the schema.

<BashCode code="postgres=# \dt schema_name.*" client:load />

It will show all the tables in the schema. You can run SQL queries to see the data in the tables.

<BashCode code="postgres=# select * from schema_name.table_name;" client:load />

It will show all the data in the table.

## Example 2 - Querying using Trino

As a second example, let's see how to query data in Trino.

You can use Trino CLI to access Trino database.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run trino shell" client:load />

You'll see `trino>` at the beginning of the line on your console.

To access the Iceberg table `orders` in the `raw` schema, you can first switch to the `raw` schema in `iceberg` catalog:

<BashCode code="trino> use iceberg.raw;" client:load />

Now you can run this command to see all the tables in the schema.

<BashCode code="trino:raw> show tables;" client:load />
