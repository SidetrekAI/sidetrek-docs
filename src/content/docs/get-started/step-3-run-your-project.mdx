# Run your data project

<SubH1>Let's use Sidetrek CLI to run your newly created data project.</SubH1>

## Run your project

You can run the following command to run the end-to-end data pipeline you've just created.

<BashCode code="sidetrek start" client:load />

Underneath, all this command is doing is running three separate commands:
1. `dagster dev` to start the Dagster server - this runs the user code (Dagster, Meltano, and DBT).
2. `docker-compose up` inside the project root to run Minio, Iceberg, and Trino.
3. `docker-compose up` inside superset directory to run Superset.

The step 1 is basically all your user code. The step 2 runs all other core services for your data pipeline. 

The step 3 runs Superset separately because it's not part of the core data pipeline. This way you can easily swap it out for another solution. 

For more details, please refer to the [Project Structure](/basics/project-structure) documentation.

Now you should have a new data project initialized. You'll see that a new directory has been created with the name of your project and all the tools have been installed.
