# Initialize your new data project

<SubH1>Let's use Sidetrek CLI to initialize your new data project.</SubH1>

## Initialize Your Project

Run the following command to start a new data project. You don't need to create an empty directory for the project - Sidetrek will create one for you.

<BashCode code="sidetrek init" client:load />

It'll walk you through a series of questions to help you set up your new data project.

Please note that currently we only have one data stack available - **Dagster-Iceberg-Trino stack** (with optional DBT and Meltano additions).

If everything went as planned, you should see the message "You're all set - enjoy building your new data project! ðŸš€". There should be a new directory with the name of your project. 

### What's Happening Underneath?

`sidetrek init` command does a few things under the hood:
- It creates a new Poetry project.
- Inside the new project, it `pip install`s all required libraries for Dagster, Meltano, DBT, and the necessary connections between them.
- In the project root, it creates a docker-compose file with all the core services: Minio, Iceberg (i.e. Iceberg REST catalog and Postgres backing the catalog), and Trino.
- It creates a new directory for Superset and clones the latest version.


Here's the project structure you should see after running `sidetrek init`:

```plaintext
your_project
â”œâ”€â”€ .sidetrek
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv
â”œâ”€â”€ superset
â”œâ”€â”€ trino
â””â”€â”€ your_project
    â”œâ”€â”€ dagster
    â”œâ”€â”€ data
    â”œâ”€â”€ dbt
    â””â”€â”€ meltano
```

For more details about the project structure, please refer to the [Project Structure](/concepts/project-structure) documentation.

## Next Steps

Now you should have a new data project initialized. It's time to run the project and see it in action!
