# Get started with Sidetrek

<SubH1>This step-by-step tutorial will walk you through how to create a new data project from scratch.</SubH1>

We'll use Sidetrek CLI to create a brand new end-to-end data project in less than 5 minutes. Your data project will include the following open-source tools:
- **Dagster** for orchestration
- **Meltano** for data ingestion
- **DBT** for data transformation
- **Minio** and **Apache Iceberg** for data storage
- **Trino** for querying your data
- **Superset** for data visualization

## What is Sidetrek?

Sidetrek is the fastest way to build a modern data stack. It's an *open-source CLI* that helps you create a data project from scratch. 

Sidetrek is built on top of popular open-source tools like Dagster, Meltano, DBT, Minio, Apache Iceberg, Trino, and Superset. We're continuously adding new tools - if you'd like to see a specific tool added, please let us know by opening an issue on our GitHub repository. 

Our roadmap includes not just data engineering tools, but also data science and machine learning tools for ML and AI use cases.

## Why Sidetrek?

Data engineering is complex! There are so many tools out there and the list just keeps growing. 

It's not only hard to keep up with the latest tools and best practices, but connecting these tools can be tricky. As a data engineer, you have so many responsibilities already. You shouldn't have to spend time figuring out how to set up and connect these tools together. 

Sidetrek simplifies the process of creating a data project by providing a curated list of tools that work well together.
