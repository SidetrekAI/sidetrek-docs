# sidetrek init

The `sidetrek init` command initializes a new Sidetrek project in the current directory.

You don't need to create a new directory before running this command. The CLI will create a new directory for you.

## Usage

<BashCode code="sidetrek init" client:load />

## Options

- `--skip-example`: Skip the example code generation.

## What's Happening Underneath

`sidetrek init` command does a few things under the hood:
- It creates a new Poetry project.
- Inside the new project, it `pip install`s all required libraries for Dagster, Meltano, DBT, and the necessary connections between them.
- In the project root, it creates a docker-compose file with all the core services: Minio, Iceberg (i.e. Iceberg REST catalog and Postgres backing the catalog), and Trino.
- It creates a new directory for Superset and clones the latest version.


Here's the project structure you should see after running `sidetrek init`:

```plaintext
your_project
├── .sidetrek
├── .venv
├── superset
├── trino
└── your_project
    ├── dagster
    ├── data
    ├── dbt
    └── meltano
```
