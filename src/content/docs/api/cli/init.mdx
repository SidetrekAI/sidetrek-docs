# init

The `init` command initializes a new Sidetrek project in the current directory by performing the following steps:

* Creates a new Poetry project: Initializes a new Python project using Poetry, a dependency management tool.

* Installs required libraries: Pip installs all necessary libraries for Dagster, Meltano, DBT, and establishes connections between them within the project environment.

* Generates docker-compose file: Creates a docker-compose.yml file in the project root, configuring core services such as Minio, Iceberg (with Iceberg REST catalog and PostgreSQL backend), and Trino.

* Sets up Superset: Creates a directory for Superset and clones the latest version, enabling seamless integration for data visualization needs.
