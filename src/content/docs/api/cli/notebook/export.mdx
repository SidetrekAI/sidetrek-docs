# sidetrek notebook export

The `sidetrek notebook export` command is used to export Jupyter notebook(s) to a Python module (`.py`) or DBT model (`.sql`).

You can either export all models in the project or specify a specific model to export. Simple run the above command and follow the interactive guide.

## Usage

Only cells with `#| export` or `#| export_dbt` directives will be exported. 

### Export Python Modules (#| export)

In the top cell of your notebook, you need to have `#| default_exp` directive to specify the module name.

```plaintext
#| default_exp my_module
```

In cell #1, you could have some Python code:

```python
#| export
print('Hello, world!')
```

In cell #2, you could have some more Python code:

```python
#| export
print('Goodbye, world!')
```

When you run `sidetrek notebook export`, cell #1 and cell #2 will now be exported as a single Python module named `my_module` and saved as `my_module.py` in the same directory as the notebook.

### Export DBT Models (#| export_dbt)

Let's say you have a notebook named `your_model.ipynb`.

In the cell where DBT code is, add `#| export_dbt` directive to export the cell as a DBT model.

```plaintext
%%writefile_dbt your_model.sql
#| export_dbt your_model.sql

with source as (
  select * from {{ ref('raw_orders') }}
)

renamed as (
  select
    id as order_id,
    user_id as customer_id,
    order_date,
  from source
)

select * from renamed
```

Note that each cell with this directive will be exported as a separate `.sql` DBT file.

When you run `sidetrek notebook export`, cell #1 will now be exported as a `your_model.sql` DBT file in the same directory as your notebook.
