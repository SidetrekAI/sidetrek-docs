# sidetrek run dbt *

The `sidetrek run dbt *` command allows you to execute DBT commands within your project virtual environment and in the right directory (DBT project root). 

## Usage

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt <any dbt command and options>" client:load />

## What's Happening Underneath?

This command provides a convenient way to run DBT CLI commands without having to move into DBT project directory and activating virtual environment.

It's identical to running:

<BashCode code="cd your_project/dbt/your_project && poetry run dbt *" client:load />

## Examples

### Check DBT Version

This command outputs the current version of DBT installed in your Sidetrek environment.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt --version" client:load />

### Run DBT Models

This command executes all models defined in your DBT project.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt run" client:load />

### Compile DBT Models

This command compiles all DBT models and generates the compiled SQL files.

<BashCode code="sidetrek run dbt compile" client:load />
