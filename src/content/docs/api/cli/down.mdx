# sidetrek down

The `sidetrek down` command stops and removes all running docker containers including Minio, Iceberg, Trino, and Superset as well as removing the docker compose networks.

## Usage

<BashCode code="sidetrek down" client:load />

## What's Happening Underneath?

This command is identical to running `docker compose down` in the project root and `docker compose down` in the `superset` directory.

It's simply running:

<BashCode code="docker compose down" client:load />

And:

<BashCode code="cd superset && docker compose down" client:load />
