# sidetrek logs

The `sidetrek logs` command allows viewing logs for any service that's running.

## Usage

<BashCode code="sidetrek logs" client:load />

Or you can specify a service to view its logs:

<BashCode code="sidetrek logs [service]" client:load />

## Options

- `-f, --follow`: Follow logs
- `--since <value>`: Only show logs since a specific time ago
- `-n, --tail`: Follow logs


## What's Happening Underneath

For most of the core services that's running in project root (like Minio, Iceberg, and Trino), it's identical to running:

<BashCode code="docker compose logs [service]" client:load />

For Superset, it's identical to running:

<BashCode code="cd superset && docker compose logs" client:load />

## Examples

Simply run `sidetrek logs`:

<BashCode code="sidetrek logs" client:load />

You'll be prompted to select a service to view the logs for:

```plaintext
Which service would you like to view the logs for?
> trino
```

Pick the service you want to view logs for and press Enter to view the logs.

Or you can specify a service to view its logs directly:

<BashCode code="sidetrek logs trino" client:load />

This command will show the logs for the running Trino docker container.
