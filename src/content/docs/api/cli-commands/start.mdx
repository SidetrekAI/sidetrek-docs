# start

The sidetrek start command initiates the Sidetrek project by executing three separate commands:

1. `dagster dev`: Starts the Dagster server, which executes user-defined code for Dagster, Meltano, and DBT.
2. `docker-compose up -d` (project root): Launches Minio, Iceberg, and Trino in the background using the docker-compose.yml file generated during initialization.
3. `docker-compose up -d` (Superset directory): Starts Superset in the background by running docker-compose up -d within the Superset directory.
